IPV4 Subnetting Concept
Rules:
1. Identify network & host requirements
2. Satisfy Network & host requirements
3. Find out Block size
4. Find out network address
5. Find out brodcast address
6. Find out valid host ip address range
7. Find out custom subnet mask & CIDR

Requirements:
IT LAN (60)
MIS LAN (60)
Sales LAN (60)

Class C:
192.168.100.0/24 - N N N H(Network*3 Host)
FLSM - Fixed length subnet mask
VLSM - Variable length subnet mask

1 1 in 128 and 64 | 0 in 32 16 8 4 2 1
128 and 64 is N and others is H
Network: 2^2 =4
Host: 2^6-2 = 62
Block size: 2^6 = 64

IP Address Allocation Table:

Subnet No.	Network Address(N.A)	Broadcast Address(B.A)	Valid Host IP Address Address Range
1st		192.168.100.0		192.168.100.63		192.168.100.1 - 192.168.100.62
2nd		192.168.100.64		192.168.100.127		192.168.100.65 - 192.168.100.126
3rd		192.168.100.128		192.168.100.191		192.168.100.129 - 192.168.100.190
4th		192.168.100.192		192.168.100.255		192.168.100.193 - 192.168.100.254

Custom Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192 (128+64)
CIDR: /26

Task: 
Network: 5
Host: 30
Address: 192.168.17.0/24
